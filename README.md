# Swift Missing Argument Label Error

This example demonstrates a common error in Swift when calling functions that require argument labels.  Swift's type system enforces these labels, making code more readable, but also leading to errors if labels are omitted.  The solution shows how to correct the function call by including the necessary argument labels.
